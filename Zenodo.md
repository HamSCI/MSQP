# How to ZIP the WAV files

1. Locate the "Save" folder containing the files you want to zip.
2. Press Ctrl + A to select all files within the folder.
3. Right click on any of the selected files, hover over "Send to", and then choose "Compressed (zipped) folder".
4. Rename (optional)
   1. Windows will create a new zip file in the same location, named after one of the original files. You can rename it as needed, ensuring the .zip extension remains. 

# Create a Zenodo Account
This is background on Zenodo and how to create an account
1. Zenodo exists to provide a free, open, and general-purpose online repository for researchers to share, preserve, and cite all kinds of digital research outputs, including data sets, software, and publications.
   1. Zenodo accepts all file formats
   2. Every upload to Zenodo receives a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), making the WAV files easily citeable and discoverable for others interested in meteor scatter research.
   3. You can create a community within Zenodo to organize meteor scatter recordings from various participants, fostering collaboration and sharing within the community.
3. The first step is to create an account, as you will not be able to make uploads without one.
4. There are several ways to create an account or sign in to Zenodo.
