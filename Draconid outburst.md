## Possible Draconid Outburst

Computer modeling of the Draconid meteor stream has shown the possibility of an outburst on **October 8** near **15:00 to 16:00 UT** for a period of about 3 hours.

The zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) could reach **400**.

The shower radiant will be low in the north from North America at that time, which means that **east-west meteor scatter paths will be favored**, but any path is worth trying.

Further info is available in *Egal et al. (2025)*.
